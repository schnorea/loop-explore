- **Loop Bounds Extraction**: Captures initialization, condition, and increment expressions
- **Hierarchical Nesting**: Properly tracks nested loop relationships
- **Source Location Mapping**: Precise line and column number tracking
- **Content Analysis**: Operations, memory access patterns, and function calls within loops

### ✅ Data Model and JSON Output (Phase 3)
- **Structured Output**: Complete JSON schema matching the specification
- **File Organization**: Hierarchical organization by file → class/function → loop
- **Analysis Summary**: Statistics on loop types, nesting levels, and function coverage
- **Call Graph**: Function relationship tracking
- **Extensible Format**: Reserved fields for future analysis capabilities

## Test Results

The implementation was tested on sample C/C++ code with the following results:

### Test Files Analyzed
1. **simple.cpp**: Basic loops without complex headers
2. **matrix.cpp**: Complex class-based code with nested loops
3. **sorting.c**: C code with various loop patterns

### Results Summary

          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "call_graph": { /* Function relationships */ }
}
```

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. **Hierarchical Loop Detection**
- Properly nests loops within their containing functions/methods
- Tracks parent-child relationships between nested loops
- Maintains correct nesting level calculations

### 2. **Comprehensive Analysis**
- **Loop Bounds**: Extracts initialization, condition, and increment
- **Memory Access**: Identifies variable reads and access patterns
- **Operations**: Classifies arithmetic and other operations
- **Location Info**: Precise source code mapping

### 3. **Robust Architecture**
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns across modules
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of parsing errors
- **Extensible**: Ready for future enhancements via extensions field
- **Configurable**: Support for different C++ standards and compiler flags

### 4. **Performance**
- Efficient AST traversal
- Reasonable processing time (3.5s for test files)
- Memory-conscious design

## Command Line Interface

The tool provides a complete CLI with all planned features:

```bash
# Basic usage
python loop_extractor.py /path/to/source

# Advanced usage
python loop_extractor.py /path/to/source \
    --output analysis.json \
    --cpp-standard c++17 \
    --include "src/*" \
    --exclude "test/*" \
    --verbose
```

## Known Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. **Header Dependencies**: Complex C++ headers (iostream, vector) cause parsing issues
2. **Template Analysis**: Templates not fully analyzed (in backlog)
3. **Cross-File Analysis**: Limited to single translation units

### Ready for Backlog Implementation
The architecture is designed to easily support the backlog features:
- ✅ Build system integration (compile_commands.json)
- ✅ Template and macro handling
- ✅ Enhanced cross-file analysis
- ✅ Advanced parallelization analysis
